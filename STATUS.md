# STATUS.md

Snapshot of where the project stands. Update this when starting/finishing significant work — don't let it go stale.

_Last updated: 2026-08-19_

## Current state
- **Version:** 1.5.2 (published)
- **Branch:** `800-package-AI-SLOP-campaign`, branched off `fix/slsa-provenance-verification`
- **Tests:** `npm test` (Node native test runner), coverage target 85%+ (`npm run test:coverage`)

## Recent work (most recent first)
- **Gap-assessment remediation (2026-08-19)** — three new detectors plus the shared libraries they required, closing the runtime-evasion, provenance-desync and workspace-persistence gaps:
  - **D29-RUNTIME-EVASION** (`tier1-runtime-evasion.js`) — Bun/Deno/QuickJS coverage. Headline fix: a Deno-idiom credential stealer that previously scored **zero findings** across the whole pipeline (the byte-identical Node version scored HIGH) now reports critical.
  - **D30-WORKSPACE-PERSISTENCE** (`tier1-workspace-persistence.js`) — `.claude/*`, `.cursor/rules/*`, `.vscode/*`, `.github/workflows/*`, with constant-folded path reconstruction so dynamically assembled paths resolve to the same target as literals. Replaces ATK-004's single `mkdir` regex.
  - **ERR_TARBALL_GIT_DESYNC** (`tier1-tarball-git-desync.js` + `backend/validators/git-diff.js`) — tarball-to-Git differential. **Opt-in, network-bound, off by default.**
  - New shared libs: `lib/ast-parse.js`, `lib/runtime-primitives.js`, `lib/path-resolver.js`, `lib/agent-surfaces.js`.
  - Also fixed a pre-existing SARIF conformance bug affecting **every** tier-1 detector (`message: {}` and an array in `artifactLocation.uri`, neither schema-valid).
  - 111 new tests; 0 findings across 123 real `node_modules` packages; 0.72% pipeline overhead.
- Added **D28-AI-SLOP-DROPPER** (`tier1-ai-slop-dropper.js`) for the "AI Slop"/WEL1DROPPER 800-package campaign: README-directed `require()` entry with no lifecycle hooks, hex/base64 string-array obfuscation, `process.platform`/`arch` fingerprinting scope-coupled to network calls, and DNS TXT out-of-band stage-2 resolution. 24 tests, 0 FPs on the clean corpus, 3.8% worst-case perf cost. See the D28 calibration notes in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
- Restricted worm-propagation patterns to lifecycle-hook scripts only, to stop false positives on `axios`/`nodemailer` (`6cb62c2`)
- Overrode `brace-expansion` to `5.0.9` to resolve GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg (`f4feb21`)
- Supply chain detection gap analysis & implementation — added TIER1-HOOK-FOLLOWTHROUGH, TIER1-VERSION-BACKFILL, TIER1-CRYPTO-TAMPER detectors, extended TIER1-INFOSTEALER and TIER1-MAINTAINER-COMPROMISE, added serverless PaaS domain watchlist (`7063b67` + follow-up lint/formatting fixes)
- Added VINCE (CISA) vulnerability coordination module and `submit-vince` CLI command (v1.5.0)

## In progress / open threads
- **D29/D30 weights are pre-telemetry.** Verified against the gap-analysis PoCs and 123 real `node_modules` packages, but *not* against the 50-package clean corpus, because `test/detectors-corpus.test.js` cannot run on Windows (`execSync` hands GNU tar a `C:\…` path it reads as a remote host — 108 failures, 0 assertion failures, pre-existing). **Re-run the corpus suite on Linux before trusting the FP numbers.**
- **D31 needs a real-registry trial.** All tests use an injected `sourceProvider`; the GitHub codeload path has not been exercised against live repositories. Expect calibration work on the generated-file skip list before it can be enabled by default.
- **D28 still parses independently** with its own `acorn.parse` rather than the shared cached `parseSource`. Migrating it would remove one parse per file and inherit the hashbang/modern-syntax fix — D28 remains evadable by an `#!/usr/bin/env bun` line and by a `.ts` rename.
- **`lib/prompt-injection.js` remains dead code** (call-signature mismatch in `index.js`, and 11 of 15 patterns lack `/g` inside a `while(exec())` loop). Not touched here — it was outside this change's scope, and the two defects must be fixed in one commit or the fix arms a process-killing infinite loop.
- **P0 — SLSA provenance path is non-functional.** `lib/slsa-verifier.js` misreads `dist.attestations` (object, not array), so every package reports "no provenance" and the provenance-discount pipeline is dead code. Verification is also non-cryptographic by design. See [docs/security/gap-analysis-2026-08.md](docs/security/gap-analysis-2026-08.md) §1–§2 — fix both together, not just the shape bug.
- **P1 — uncovered install-time surfaces:** `.pnpmfile.cjs`, `.yarnrc.yml` plugins, `bunfig.toml`, and MCP/agent hook configs (`.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json` hooks). Same doc, §5–§6.
- D6a (version-anomaly) heuristic is a known FP-risk area pending production scan telemetry
- D24/D25 (Bun runtime swap / split payload) pattern weights need tuning once broader scan telemetry is available
